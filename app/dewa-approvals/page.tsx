                DEWA approval is not one document and it is not one meeting. For a Dubai project, it can involve Building NOC - Electricity, electricity permits and connections, design approval, connection estimates, additional load, fit-out connection, utility NOC, LV inspection, HV inspection, transformer coordination, cable works, testing, commissioning and final supply release. The correct route depends on location, authority jurisdiction, building use, connected load, maximum demand, existing supply, landlord requirements, consultant scope and site readiness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emitronix approaches DEWA approval as an engineering workflow. The objective is to prevent the classic Dubai project failure pattern: construction moves quickly, the electrical submission is treated as admin, the drawings do not match the site, a landlord NOC is missing, inspection is requested too early, and the handover date becomes exposed. A strong DEWA strategy ties documents, design, site execution, inspection and completion records together from the start.
              </p>
              <p>
                This guide covers DEWA new connection, additional load, load reduction, LV approval, HV approval, electrical design approval, electrical inspection, testing and commissioning, temporary power supply, permanent power connection, transformer installation, transformer relocation, package substation, pocket substation, compact substation, HV cable works, LV cable works, utility coordination, shutdown planning, authority coordination and project completion across Dubai and the wider UAE.
